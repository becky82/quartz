# Quartz: a Latin square autotopism game

Quartz is a game where the user finds a Latin square satisfying a given symmetry property (an autotopism).

From this perspective, a Latin square is equivalent to a quasigroup, hence "Quartz", short for <b>qu</b>asigroup <b>aut</b>omorphism<b>s</b>

When you click a cell, it changes its symbol to the next symbol that doesn't violate the necessary conditions (the LCM conditions) for a Latin square to have an autotopism.

At the moment, the game is in development, so don't expect too much.
